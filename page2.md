## No Cheating

You are probably saying how can cheating prevent one from passing. Aggie Code of Honor
For many years Aggies have followed a Code of Honor, which is stated in this very simple verse:

An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.
Getting caught cheating can result in a 0 on a exam. I can probably not study at all and go in blindly and still make a higher grade than a 0. So there you have it, study more, drink plenty of coffee, and stay true to the Aggie's Honor Code.
Gig em!

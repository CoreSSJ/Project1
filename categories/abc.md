Are you a coffee drinker? Do you add some extra sugar to your coffee when you know that you will be staying up late to prepare for an exam or this big presentation. 
In this blog, I would like to discuss the pros and cons of drinking students who drink coffee daily.

According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine, 92 percent of college students drink coffee, and 79 percent of said coffee-drinkers use caffeine to stay awake. Whether students need to wake up early or stay up late, they turn to caffeine to push themselves to keep going. According to a study published on the same site, 80 percent of the Western adult population consumes enough caffeine to have an effect on their brains.
